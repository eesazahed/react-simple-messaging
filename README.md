# react-social
A social media test website that is made with react.

This is completely open to anyone and does not require sign up/log in. All you have to do is write your name and select a message. You can reload it to recieve new messages. Once you send a message, you can delete it afterwards.

This project uses Google's free firebase service. The firebase rules allow any user to edit, change, or delete anything without having to sign up. Since this is only a test, you can add whatever. Just keep an appropriate username please, and if you see one that isn't, don't hesistate to delete it. Once you delete something, it is fully deleted off the database (you can check the code yourself, src/App.js line 89)
